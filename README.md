# Connect4 Agent Implementation

## Overview
This project involves creating an agent capable of playing and winning the game Connect4. The game is played on a 6x7 grid where two players alternate dropping colored discs into a vertically suspended grid. The objective is to connect four of one's own discs in a row, whether horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Features
- Implementation of an agent that can defeat another in Connect4.
- Use of the MiniMax algorithm with depth limitation for game strategy.
- Enhancements like alpha-beta pruning and transposition tables for optimized performance.
